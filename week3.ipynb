    "Conting sort solves the issue of not being able to sort lists with duplicate keys. To do so at each index in the direct access array another data structure is used to store the keys. This would help in the event of collisions arising from duplicate keys. For radix sort it is important that the order of the duplicate keys is the same for the output from sorting as it is for the input (i.e stable sorting). To do so a sequence data structure needs to be used at each index of the direct access array. In the implementation below a python list is used to do so. \n",

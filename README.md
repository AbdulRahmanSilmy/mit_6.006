# mit_6.006

The aim of this repository is to document my self-study of algorithms and data structures. I'm using [MIT's 6.006 Introduction to algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/) as my study guide. 

This repository contains the programming implementations of algorithms, data structures and solutions to problem sets.
